abstract = {Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) have received increasing attention in recent years as many novel applications involving interactions with an unknown and dynamic environment including humans require actuators with dynamics that are not well-achieved by classical stiff actuators. This paper presents an overview of the different VIAs developed and proposes a classification based on the principles through which the variable stiffness and damping are achieved. The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses. This classification allows for designers of new devices to orientate and take inspiration and users of VIA's to be guided in the design and implementation process for their targeted application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The hole in the bushing has an upper portion forming a small-diameter portion and a lower portion forming a large-diameter portion. An operation shaft extends through the hole in the bushing. The operation shaft has an upper portion forming a small-diameter portion and a lower portion forming a large-diameter portion. The operation shaft is rotatable circumferentially relative to the bushing, and is movable axially relative to the bushing. The small-diameter portion of the operation shaft extends upward from the small-diameter portion of the hole in the bushing, and the large-diameter portion of the operation shaft is greater in diameter than the small-diameter portion of the hole in the bushing. A rotary component portion includes a rotatable member. The rotatable member is coupled to a lower portion of the operation shaft. The rotatable member is allowed to rotate together with the operation shaft and to be stationary independent of axial movement of the operation shaft. A first contact is fixed to a lower surface of the rotatable member. A second contact is resilient, and is provided on a fixed base plate. The second contact relatively slides on the first contact as the rotatable member rotates. A push switch portion is located below the rotary component portion, and engages a lower end of the operation shaft. The push switch portion operates when being pressed by the lower end of the operation shaft in accordance with axial movement of the operation shaft.},

@article{DurrantWhyte1994,
abstract = {The mobile robot navigation problem essentially poses three questions: (1) Where am I? (2) Where am I going? (3) How do I get there? The first question is simply one of knowing where the vehicle is at all times. The second question is mainly concerned with planning and tasking. The third question is one of local and global path control. This tutorial is aimed at understanding the first of these questions; determining exactly where the robot is at all times. We will call this position determination capability localization. Localization is of paramount importance in all practical mobile robot applications. Without a localization capability it is almost impossible to address the remaining problems in navigation sensibly. In this tutorial, we will first describe the basic navigation process in terms of an algorithm called the Kalman filter. With this algorithm, we will then describe how simple beacon-based navigation systems work and show two examples of working beacon-based localization systems. We will then show how the same algorithm can be used to work out the location of a vehicle using only “natural beacons” or simply a geometric model of the robot environment, and we describe a system that does just this using an array of sonar sensors. We then move on to the somewhat harder problem of actually building and maintaining a map of the environment that can simultaneously be used in vehicle localization problems. We show that this too can be solved using similar methods to beacon-based navigation systems. Finally we outline where we believe research on navigation methods will go over the next few years, and we provide a short annotated bibliography for further reading.},

We propose a comprehensive care system that aims to provide personalized care guidance services and comprehensive, proactive and effective management of patients with different severity of COPD. The main component of the system is a patient-centered, new model of chronic disease management -Comprehensive Care Pathway. Firstly, we combine the support vector machines (SVM), the decision tree (DT) and the random forest (RF) algorithm to make a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition, and then provide the patient with a personalized and reasonable home rehabilitation comprehensive care plan based on the evaluation results. In addition, the system provides for the detection of events related to exacerbations of COPD and triggers an alert mechanism to alert patients and physicians that interventions can be made in time for the deterioration of patients. The system has been validated using data collected from 35 patients that have been marked by physicians and obtained satisfactory results.},

@article{MacNee2005,
abstract = {The current paradigm for the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is that chronic airflow limitation results from an abnormal inflammatory response to inhaled particles and gases in the lung. Airspace inflammation appears to be different in susceptible smokers and involves a predominance of CDS+ T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. Studies have characterized inflammation in the peripheral airspaces in different stages of disease severity. Two other processes have received considerable research attention. The first is a protease-antiprotease imbalance, which has been linked to the pathogenesis of emphysema. However, the hypothesis of an increased protease burden associated with functional inhibition of antiproteases has been difficult to prove and is now considered an oversimplification. The second process, oxidative stress, has a role in many of the pathogenic processes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may be one mechanism that enhances the inflammatory response. In addition, it has been proposed that the development of emphysema may involve alveolar cell loss through apoptosis. This mechanism may involve the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway and oxidative stress.},

Such a situation has given more emphasis to the rise of robotics as a possible solution to deal with the demographic change and the new social norms in the care of elderly and disabled people.

Following, robotic versions of wheeled-walkers for assisting locomotion dysfunctions are presented. In this context, the UFES Smart Walker is presented as an example of a robotic device focused on the user-machine multimodal interaction for obtaining a natural control strategy for the robotic device. Two developments are discussed: (i) an adaptive filtering strategy of the upper-body interaction forces is used in a Fuzzy-Logic based control system to generate navigation commands, and (ii) a robust inverse kinematics controller based on users-motion is presented as a new solution for controlling the Smart Walker motion. Finally, conclusions and future works in the field of walker-assisted gait is presented in the last section.},

Its prevalence has increased as overall mortality from myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident, the two organ systems affected by the same risk factor (namely, cigarette smoking), has decreased. Once diagnosed, COPD is progressive and leads to disability usually due to dyspnea, at a relatively early age (sixth or seventh decade). Limitation to airflow occurs as a consequence of the destruction of lung parenchyma or the alterations in the airway itself. This chapter integrates the pathological changes of COPD with the known adaptive and maladaptive consequences of those changes. Knowledge of these factors should help us understand the rationale behind the different therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing the symptoms and addressing the complications of patients with COPD.},

As a robot collects data, uncertainty about its position accumulates and corrupts its knowledge of the positions from which observations are taken. We address this problem by employing cooperative localization; that is, deploying a second robot to observe the other as it explores, thereby establishing a virtual tether, and enabling an accurate estimate of the robot's position while it constructs the map. This paper presents our approach to this problem in the context of learning a set of visual landmarks useful for pose estimation. In addition to developing a formalism and concept, we validate our results experimentally and present quantitative results demonstrating the performance of the method.},

PRP consists of three omni-directional wheels with servo brakes and a controller. It can manipulate an object by controlling an external force/moment applied by a human based on the control of the servo brakes. We consider the characteristics of the servo brakes and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that several motion functions of PRP are realized based on the applied force. This allows PRP to track a path which includes motion perpendicular to the pushing direction of the human without using servo motors. The impedance-based motion control is also realized with respect to the perpendicular to the pushing direction. These functions are implemented on PRP experimentally, and the experimental results illustrate the validity of PRP and its control method. {\textcopyright} 2009 VSP.},

@article{Cherubini2008,
abstract = {Assistive technology is an emerging area, where robotic devices can help individuals with motor disabilities to achieve independence in daily activities. This paper deals with a system that provides remote control of Sony AIBO, a commercial mobile robot, within the assistive project ASPICE. The robot can be controlled by various input devices, including a Brain-Computer Interface. AIBO has been chosen for its friendly-looking aspect, in order to ease interaction with the patients. The development of the project is described by focusing on the design of the robot navigation system. Single step, semi-autonomous and autonomous navigation modes have been realized to provide different levels of control. Automatic collision avoidance is integrated in all cases. Other features of the system, such as the video feedback from the robotic platform to the user, and the use of AIBO as communication aid, are briefly described. The performance of the navigation system is shown by simulations as well as experiments. The system has been clinically validated, in order to obtain a definitive assessment through patient feedback. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Fasola2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and user study evaluation of a socially assistive robot (SAR) system designed to engage elderly users in physical exercise aimed at achieving health benefits and improving quality of life. We discuss our design methodology, which incorporates insights from psychology research in the area of intrinsic motivation, and focuses on maintaining engagement through personalized social interaction. We describe two user studies conducted to test the motivation theory in practice with our system. The first study investigated the role of praise and relational discourse in the exercise system by comparing a relational robot coach to a nonrelational robot coach. The second study evaluated participant preferences regarding user choice in the task scenario. Both studies served to evaluate the feasibility and overall effectiveness of the robot exercise system. The results of both studies are presented; they show a strong user preference for the relational over the nonrelational robot in terms of enjoyableness, companionship, and as an exercise coach, varying user preferences regarding choice, and high user ratings of the system across multiple metrics. The outcomes of the presented user studies, brought together, support the motivational capabilities of the robot, and demonstrate the viability and usefulness of the system in motivating exercise in elderly users. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Gaggioli2006,
abstract = {Objective. To investigate the technical and clinical viability of using computer-facilitated mental practice in the rehabilitation of upper-limb hemiparesis following stroke. Design. A single-case study. Setting. Academic-affiliated rehabilitation center. Participant. A 46-year-old man with stable motor deficit of the upper right limb following subcortical ischemic stroke. Intervention. Three computer-enhanced mental practice sessions per week at the rehabilitation center, in addition to usual physical therapy. A custom-made virtual reality system equipped with arm-tracking sensors was used to guide mental practice. The system was designed to superimpose over the (unseen) paretic arm a virtual reconstruction of the movement registered from the nonparetic arm. The laboratory intervention was followed by a 1-month home-rehabilitation program, making use of a portable display device. Main outcome measures. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical assessment measures were the upper-extremity scale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Sensorimotor Impairment and the Action Research Arm Test. Performance of the affected arm was evaluated using the healthy arm as the control condition. Results. The patient's paretic limb improved after the first phase of intervention, with modest increases after home rehabilitation, as indicated by functional assessment scores and sensors data. Conclusion. Results suggest that technology-supported mental training is a feasible and potentially effective approach for improving motor skills after stroke.

abstract = { A wide range of human–robot collaborative applications in diverse domains, such as manufacturing, health care, the entertainment industry, and social interactions, require an autonomous robot to follow its human companion. Different working environments and applications pose diverse challenges by adding constraints on the choice of sensors, degree of autonomy, and dynamics of a person-following robot. Researchers have addressed these challenges in many ways and contributed to the development of a large body of literature. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the literature by categorizing different aspects of person-following by autonomous robots. Also, the corresponding operational challenges are identified based on various design choices for ground, underwater, and aerial scenarios. In addition, state-of-the-art methods for perception, planning, control, and interaction are elaborately discussed and their applicability in varied operational scenarios is presented. Then some of the prominent methods are qualitatively compared, corresponding practicalities are illustrated, and their feasibility is analyzed for various use cases. Furthermore, several prospective application areas are identified, and open problems are highlighted for future research. }
